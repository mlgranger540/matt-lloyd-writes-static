            <h2>Writing History</h2>
            <div>
                <p>The world of writing and storytelling is not a new interest for me. I have been in love with books ever since I was little, and principally since I first started reading <em>Harry Potter</em>. And I enjoyed writing my own stories even then, too.</p>
                <p>The first story I remember writing was in primary school. In it, a child discovers a secret tunnel in the side of a hill that leads through into another world. I've always loved fiction and especially fantasy above anything else.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>In year 7, I became obsessed with a book series called <em>Warrior Cats</em>, about the lives of wild cats that live in clans. And I decided to write my own version of this idea - something I now recognise to be, of course, essentially a piece of fanfiction.</p>
                <p>But it was at the age of 14 that my writing infatuation really kicked off, and that was with two things: my first proper novel idea, <em>Curfew</em>, and me and my friend's discovery of the wonderful world of fanfiction.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>Our first fanfiction idea was born in October 2011, followed shortly by the first drafts of <em>Curfew</em> - and this was just the beginning. Soon, I had dozens of ideas for both original stories and fanfics, and pretty much all of my free time was spent writing. I even used to keep bits of scrap paper in my pencil case to bring to school in order to carry on writing there.</p>
                <p>By the age of 18, I had 18 stories to match. Now, 6 years later, I have at least 28 book or series ideas, with more possiblities besides, as well as uncountable number of short stories and fanfics. And I still get new ideas almost every single day.</p>
                <p>So here's to the written word, and to many more stories yet to come.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

    <!-- Genre and Audience Panel -->
    <section id="about-genre-audience">
        <div id="genre-audience-panel" class="panel about-panel">
            <h2>Genre and Audience</h2>
            <div>
                <p>There are all sorts of genres that a story can explore, but for me they have pretty much fallen into three areas:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sci-fi</li>
                    <li>Fantasy</li>
                    <li>Romance</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Sci-fi and fantasy are genres I've always been really into from books, TV and films, so naturally most of my writing falls into these areas too. Though, as sci-fi tends to require more technical knowledge and research to make the science part believable, I usually stick more to fantasy.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>But one of my favourite things to write, and the thing I think I've always been best at, is anything to do with people and relationships, dialogue and emotions. So romance and drama plotlines are also a big part of pretty much all my stories.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>There are also a variety of audience types you can aim your writing at, and my stories tend to be geared towards one of these audiences:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Teen</li>
                    <li>Young Adult</li>
                    <li>Adult</li>
                </ul>
                <p>As I started writing from the age of 14, a lot of my earlier story ideas were aimed at audiences of a similar age, and with similarly aged characters. As I've got older, my content and characters have got older too. So I now have a variety of types of stories - some aimed at teens with teenaged characters, some aimed at young adults with characters in their late teens to early twenties, and some aimed at adults with characters in their mid twenties or older.</p>

    <!-- Why I Write Panel -->
    <section id="about-why-write">
        <div id="why-write-panel" class="panel about-panel">
            <h2>Why I Write</h2>
            <div>
                <p>It's hard to explain why I love writing so much. When you say to people that you spend your free time writing and reading, it sounds more like an assessment for your English lit class than a fun hobby. But there's so much more to it than just putting words onto a page.</p>
                <p>The world is not exactly a fun place a lot of the time, especially when you have anxiety like I do, or, for instance, when the entire world has been taken over by a pandemic. But that's what's so incredible about fiction. With a few words, you can escape this world, and journey into an entirely new one - one where anything is possible.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>Writing just takes that one step further. Because not only are you visiting another world... you're creating one. And the only limits are your imagination.</p>
                <p>It sounds cliché, but it's true. Writing is the best from of creation, and reading is the best form of escape. It's falling in love - with the world that is created, with the characters that are born, with the words on a page that somehow manage to make you laugh and cry and hate and love and feel everything it's possible to feel. It's just... magic.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>So I suppose, in the end, it's actually quite simple to say why I write. I write because I think of something that doesn't exist, and I want it to - so I create it. Because if I didn't, it would never exist. And that would be too much of a shame to bear.</p>
