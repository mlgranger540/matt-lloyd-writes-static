            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <div>
                <p>The hardest part of writing is getting started. Staring at that blank page trying to think of that all important first word, first line. It's daunting for even the most experienced writers. My advice? Just start writing. It doesn't have to be good. It doesn't even have to be the beginning. Just start putting down anything you can think of, any ideas you have. Once you've started, it's so much easier to carry on. And you can go back and change, revise, delete as many times as you need to. Just - start. You'll regret it so much more if you don't.</p>
                <p>There are many 'do's and 'don't's for writing out there, which wannabe writers will inevitably come across at one time or another. But having been writing for over ten years, I've learnt that a lot of these so-called 'rules of writing' should be seen more as guidelines at best - or even mere suggestions. In fact, when overused, some of them can lead to bad writing practices and clunky and overblown writing.</p>
                <p>A lot of these are things they teach you in creative writing lessons, or things that will be flagged up in spell/grammar checkers. But in fact, most of the time, they are not things that are 'right' and 'wrong', but rather things that are up to each writer's choice and writing style.</p>
                <p>So here are my tips, which I've picked up over my time as a writer, and a lot of which contradict the tips you might see elswhere.</p>

        <!-- Writing Tips Panel -->
        <div id="tips" class="panel studio-card">
            <h2>Writing Tips</h2>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use small words</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Don't use long, complex words just because you can. In creative writing lessons, they like to tell you that you need to use a wide range of vocabulary to write a good descriptive scene and get an emotional response. In my experience, it's quite the opposite. Using too many big words for the sake of it is more likely to make your writing sound pretentious or like you're trying too hard. Sometimes, a small word is the best word. And they can be the most emotive words of all.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Don't be afraid to use 'said'</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Another common thought is that using 'said' is a big no-no. Not true. Sometimes, people say things. They don't utter them or declare them or exclaim them. Of course, you should try not to overuse any word, but there's nothing wrong with using 'said' quite a lot during dialogue sections. As with the first tip - if you try and use a different verb every time someone speaks, that's going to stand out a lot more and just start to sound silly.</li>
                        <li>Another thing you can do if you feel like you're using 'said' too much is throw an adverb after it. Things like 'he said softly' or 'she said nervously' are another great way of changing things up and adding to the mood of a scene.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>The short vs long rule goes for sentences too</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You should use a variety of sentence types in your writing - but don't think that a longer sentence is automatically a better one. As with words - short sentences are often the most impactful by far. A three-word sentence can break your heart or put it back together again. A one-word sentence can shock you to your core. You can even have a one-word paragraph - or a bunch of them in a row. Spell checkers say different, and will usually flag these kinds of sentences up as 'fragments'. Maybe if you're writing an essay or a CV they're not appropriate - but in prose writing, they can be one of the most powerful elements of your whole story.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Show and tell</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This is one of the most common writing rules out there: <em>show not tell</em>. And honestly, I'm not even entirely sure what it means. I think the idea is, rather than having a sentence directly telling the reader something, such as 'Sarah was afraid of spiders', you should include a scene where she exhibits this fear to show it to the reader. Now, I sort of get where they're coming from... but also not. I mean, sure, in a lot of cases it's better to be more descriptive. But if you have to create a scene to <em>show</em> every single thing that happens, I feel like that could get very tiresome. Sometimes, you might want to just tell the reader something, and I think that's okay.</li>
                        <li>I can also see instances where a simple sentence telling the reader something could be really effective. Especially to create a sinister atmosphere. Something like, 'The room was empty, bar from a single spider clinging to its web in the corner. Sarah hated spiders.' (That's also a good example of short sentences with simple language being used to effect, too.) So, I think this is another case of <em>no rule applies universally to all situations and types of writing</em>.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Epithets are not as bad as people say</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For those that aren't familiar, epithets are when you use something like 'the old man' instead of 'he' or 'John'. Another writing tip you'll hear is that epithets should <strong>never, ever</strong> be used - they are the spawn of satan and ruin every piece of writing they touch. This is another one that, for me, just isn't the case. Overuse of epithets is a problem, often with new writers who are trying to avoid using 'he' or 'she' too much. And I do agree that epithets shouldn't be used too often, and people can get a little carried away (no one's going to take your writing very seriously if you've come up with five hundred ways of referring to a single character, especially if you're getting into the realm of things like 'the bespectacled young fashion designer').</li>
                        <li>But I don't agree that they are never okay to use. In fact, sometimes they can be very helpful in clarifying who's saying or doing what, especially when you have a lot of characters in a scene, and particularly characters of the same gender interacting for a long period of time. As long as it's clear who 'the dark-haired boy' and 'the older man' are, then I say what's the problem? Used minimally and sparingly, epithets can be a perfectly helpful writing tool.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>But the biggest piece of advice that I can offer is quite simply this:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>There is no one-size-fits-all rulebook for writing</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>That includes my list of tips here. If you disagree - if you don't think these tips will make your writing better, then don't follow them. Simple as that. Do what sounds good to <em>you</em> - what <em>you</em> think makes your writing good. After all - you are the first and most important audience that you're writing for. If you love what you're writing, then that's all that matters.</p>
                <p>And don't be afraid to be bad to start with. Everyone's writing is bad when they first start out. Looking back, some of my earliest pieces of writing are absolutely horrendous. But the best way to improve your writing isn't to look at a list of tips or rules. It's simply to write. Write more, read more - just practice, and as time goes on you'll hone your writing voice and find the style that works for you. And then you'll be able to write stuff you're really proud of.</p>
